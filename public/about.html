<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Raymart Palacio currently a Computer Engineering Student here in the Philippines
  My goal is to be a successful person but to start that, I need to home my skills in order for me to achieve
  what I desire. Learning Programming is a huge stepping stone for me because I prefer to work in a 
  Software Industry rather in the Computer Engineer. Software are much more indemand nowadays and has a higher pay
  and it is flexible where you can work anywhere or even at home as long as you have the requirement tools such as laptop or computer and internet.

<p>I was a former chef that work in a Korean Restaurant and it is one of my hobby is by cooking and make delicious foods where I can show off what I'm capable of.
  My mother inspires me to cook since when I was still young, although it didn't matter to me at that young age then I realize it when I reached my adulthood staged.

<p>I'm a very competitve person and also a Team Player. But finishing the tasks that was given by our superior is a must to do before the dute date.
  Being a competitive person made me work harder, focus, and pursue a higher goal in life.
  They say being competitve is a bad thing. But as for me who have a vision for myself, I'd say that it is only for those who have goal in their life that want
  to reach not just for myself but also to make my Parents proud.
